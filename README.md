# O-Mote
Open source home entertainment remote!

This project is just getting off the ground. If you'd like to contribute time or resources, please reach out to me via Issue! 

# Project Principles
These are the principles which will drive the development goals of this project.

1. Software and hardware of all remote components shoudl be open source
2. Core features of the device (controlling home entertainment components with the remote) should work without an internet connection; however, more features can leverage internet features
